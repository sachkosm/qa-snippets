1.	Difference between string and stringbuilder
string instance is immutable
System.Text.StringBuilder is mutable
That means, using the StringBuilder class can boost performance when concatenating
many strings together in a loop

2.	Difference between overload and override
Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method
name but different parameters. Overriding means having two methods with the same
method name and parameters (i.e., method signature). One of the methods is in
the parent class and the other is in the child class.

4.	How do you structure a webforms application code
<Form >
<input
<button
</form>
5.	Describe a difficult problem that you solved using asp.net

6.	What should you do in the catch portion of a try/catch block
A try / catch statement can contain several catch blocks, to handle different
exceptions in different ways. Each catch block must take a parameter of a different
throwable class. A thrown object may match several catch block but only the first
catch block that matches the object will be executed.

7.	You have a return statement in the try, will finally be executed
Because a finally block will always be called unless you call System.exit()
(or the thread crashes). If the JVM exits while the try or catch code is being
executed, then the finally block may not execute. ... if there is any return
statement in the block(s),finally will be executed prior to that return statement

8.	How can you create a job scheduler in a webforms web application
Create a webservice method such as DoSuchAndSuchProcess
Create a console app that calls this webmethod.
Schedule the console app in the task scheduler.

9.	Difference between an arraylist and a generic list.
ArrayList is a non-generic collection class and resides in System.Collection
namespace whereas List is a generic class and resides in System.Collections.Generic namespace

ArrayList marks = new ArrayList();
marks.Add(50);
marks.Add(70.5);
marks.Add("Sixty");

List<int> marks = new List<int>();
marks.Add(50);
marks.Add(70);
marks.Add(60);

10.	Why did you choose to develop in asp.net

11.	When using user controls, how do you limit database calls for the same information
if multiple user controls are displaying similar data

cache
public DataTable GetCustomers(bool BypassCache)
{
   string cacheKey = "CustomersDataTable";
   object cacheItem = Cache[cacheKey] as DataTable;
   if((BypassCache) || (cacheItem == null))
   {
      cacheItem = GetCustomersFromDataSource();
      Cache.Insert(cacheKey, cacheItem, null,
      DateTime.Now.AddSeconds(GetCacheSecondsFromConfig(cacheKey),
      TimeSpan.Zero);
   }
   return (DataTable)cacheItem;
}

12.	Is C# managed or unmanaged? What does that mean?
Managed code is not compiled to machine code but to an intermediate language which is
interpreted and executed by some service on a machine and is therefore operating within a (hopefully!)
secure framework which handles dangerous things like memory and threads for you.
In modern usage this frequently means .NET but does not have to.

Unmanaged code is compiled to machine code and therefore executed by the OS directly.
It therefore has the ability to do damaging/powerful things Managed code does not.
This is how everything used to work, so typically it's associated with old stuff like .dlls

13.	Can you use Web API in webforms? How?
Ajax calls to Web API

14.	What is the null coalesce operator?
string pageTitle = suppliedTitle ?? "Default Title";


15.	How do you create an anonymous type?
var myAnonymousType = new
                        {
                            firstProperty = "First",
                            secondProperty = 2,
                            thirdProperty = true,
                            anotherAnonymousType = new { nestedProperty = "Nested"}
                        };

16.	How can you implement more than 1 POST method in a Web API class?
By using routes
[RoutePrefix("api/VTRouting")]
public class VTRoutingController : ApiController
{
    [HttpPost]
    [Route("Route")]
    public MyResult Route(MyRequestTemplate routingRequestTemplate)
    {
        return null;
    }

    [HttpPost]
    [Route("TSPRoute")]
    public MyResult TSPRoute(MyRequestTemplate routingRequestTemplate)
    {
        return null;
    }
}

17.	How do you prevent a reference type variable from changing its value when the source object changes.
For example, object1=object2, now object1 property changes but we don’t want object2 to change.

18.	What is the virtual keyword used for?
The virtual keyword is used to modify a method, property, indexer, or event declared in the base class
and allow it to be overridden in the derived class.

19.	How can you mix code-behind with front end code in an aspx page?
The field must be declared public

20.	How can you hide (method hiding) code-behind methods in an aspx page?
using virtual and "new"
public virtual void HideMe()
public new void HideMe()
